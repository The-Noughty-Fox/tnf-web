Alex went above and beyond to investigate and implement 3 major fixes for my app. I've worked with dozens of freelancers over the last 10 years running an app business - he has skill and experience and communication that is very hard to find. I plan to hire him again very soon. Communication was fantastic and he delivered exactly what I asked for, in much less time than I expected. Thank you so much!",
