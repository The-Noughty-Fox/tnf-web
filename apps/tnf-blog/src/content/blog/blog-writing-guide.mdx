# Blog writing guide

Markup language offers a simple way to format text. It is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the Web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

In order to make a space between paragraphs, you need to add an empty line between them.

# Headings

To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (h3), you'd use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header). You can add up to six number signs.
```markdown
1. # H1
2. ## H2
3. ### H3
4. #### H4
5. ##### H5
6. ###### H6
```

# Paragraph

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. A line of text that contains only spaces, tabs, form feeds, and backslashes, followed by a line containing only spaces, tabs, form feeds, and backslashes, is a blank line.

# Images

For image we will use a special component called Figure.astro. Here is an example of how to use it:
```markdown
<Figure
    alt='...'
    src='...'
    caption='...'
    width='...'
    height='...'
    maxHeight='...' (Optional) Used in case you want to limit the height of the image
/>
```

# Blockquotes

#### Syntax

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a footer or cite element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.
```markdown
> Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.
> **Note** that you can use _Markdown syntax_ within a blockquote.
```

#### Output

> Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.
> **Note** that you can use _Markdown syntax_ within a blockquote.

## Blockquote with attribution

#### Syntax

```markdown
> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.<br>
> — <cite>Rob Pike[^1]</cite>
```

#### Output

> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.<br></br>
> — <cite>Rob Pike[^1]</cite>

# Code Blocks

we can use 3 backticks ``` in new line and write snippet and close with 3 backticks on new line and to highlight language specific syntax, write one word of language name after first 3 backticks, for eg. html, javascript, css, markdown, typescript, txt, bash

#### Syntax

````markdown
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Test</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
````

#### Output

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Test</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

# List Types

#### Ordered List

##### Syntax

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

##### Output

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

##### Ordered List

##### Syntax

```markdown
- List item

```

##### Output
